AgileAce is a web-based agile planning tool built with React, TypeScript, and Socket.io. It allows software development teams to estimate and prioritize tasks using planning poker cards and collaborate in real-time.

The app also provides a summary of the estimation process, making it easier for teams to prioritize and plan their work.
